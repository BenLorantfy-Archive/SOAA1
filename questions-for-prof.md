# Unresolved Questions

- How can we provide the "Message didn't contain EOM" error? How do we know the difference between "message doesn't contain EOM" and "message hasn't finished sending yet"?
- In the Execute Service Message type, does <num segments> include the first segment?
- Do we have to send a newline after the EOM charachter?
